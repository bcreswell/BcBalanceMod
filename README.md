# BcBalanceMod
Mod for Slay the Spire. Makes changes to the 4 base characters and some of the core mechanics. Adds about 10 new cards for each character.

# Mechanics Changes
Artifact - no longer blocks self inflicted debuffs. You can still remove these with Orange Pellets though.

Intangible - Block doesn't work while Intangible. But it is tracked and restored to you after Intangible expries for the sake of blur, barricade, body slam etc.

# Google Doc
Description of the mod. Work in progress. All the new cards are shown here. Still working on the descriptions for all of the changed cards.
