# BcBalanceMod
Mod for Slay the Spire. 

Reworks many of the base game mechanics and cards for the original 4 characters. 
- New Neow Bonuses
- New Boss Relic Screen: choose from 3 Boss Relics & 2 Rare Relics
- 2 New Ascensions to replace Ascensions 12 & 13
- Redesigned Curse removal system
- Designed several enemy encounters
- About half of the original cards have been modified in some way

New Content
- 45 new cards split among original 4 characters (no new orb types or stances)
- 7 new relics
- 4 new potions

The goal of this mod is not to balance around win rate or character performance, but rather to make sure all the cards and their upgrades are tempting and interesting.
