# BcBalanceMod
Mod for Slay the Spire. 

Reworks many of the base game mechanics and cards for the original 4 characters. 
- New Neow Bonuses
- New Boss Relic Screen: choose from 3 Boss Relics & 2 Rare Relics
- 2 New Ascensions to replace Ascensions 12 & 13
- Redesigned Curse removal system
- Designed several enemy encounters
- About half of the original cards have been modified in some way

New Content
- 45 new cards split among original 4 characters (no new orb types or stances)
- 7 new relics
- 4 new potions

The goal of this mod is not to balance around win rate or character performance, but rather to make sure all the cards and their upgrades are tempting and interesting.

# Latest Release
To install, put this jar in your mods folder. For windows, your mods folder might be here:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\SlayTheSpire\mods

Works with several quality of life mods (minty spire, map marks etc), but will not work with all mods due to the extensive changes it makes. If you're having trouble running it, try disabling other mods (especially content focused mods). Let me know if you find QoL mod compatibility issues or any other issues and I'll try to address them.

Eng is the only supported localization.
